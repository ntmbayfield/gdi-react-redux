// Exercise 2: Set It Up
	// write a functional component
	// make it a div with a class name of HomePage
	// import ImageUploaderForm and FeedList
	// include them inside of Homepage
	// export default the Homepage component!

// Exercise 3: Prop It Up
// Need to extract photos from data and then pass it into FeedList

// Exercise 4: Class It Up
// Turn HomePage from a functional to a class component
	// handle import/inheritance
	// add a render method

// Exercise 6: Letâ€™s Get InFormation - BONUS
	// In order to get Homepage render the photo url you have uploaded to ImageUploader form,
	// you will need to create a function called handleAddPhoto that updates photos state by
	// accepting a url and creating a new object in photos state of the homepage component.
    // Then pass in that function as props to ImageUploaderForm
    // and when the user submits, call that function with the user submitted url.


import React, { Component } from 'react';
